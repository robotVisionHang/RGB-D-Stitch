# RGB-D-Stitch
Stitch Depth and Color images

This is a MS VS solution that performs RGB-D stitching. This is based on the sample code in OpenCV 3.2.0 (stitch_detailed.cpp). Please configure the OpenCV include and library path in the solution and compile in your computer. If you use a Linux-based OS, you only need to compile the source codes (main.cpp depth_render.cpp) by linking the OpenCV libraries. We also provided the source color and depth images in a directory named as test_data, result_color.png, result_depth.png, and result_mask.png are the output of the program.
